Inspiration

Going through with the milestone project me and my group had numerous links that we all went through to help with the build of our app. Personally I always looked at 3 links to help with our journey.

Bugs
====

First group project that I have ever done so with that being said the beginning was the hardest part whenever we had to commit our own changes without messing up the whole project was the most difficult part. 
A ton of trial and error that I had to go through to make things work with my peers. Now personally my project doesn't have the backend working and everyone in my group except one person got it to work so that is the one bug that is in my repository. But other than that it should work fine.
